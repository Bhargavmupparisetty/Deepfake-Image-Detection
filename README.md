# Deepfake Image Detection 

This project aims to detect deepfake images using MesoNet, a neural network architecture specifically designed for detecting manipulated images. The project includes pre-trained MesoNet weights, a Google Colab notebook, and all necessary files for running the detection pipeline.

## Features

- **Deepfake Detection:** Detect manipulated images using the MesoNet model.
- **Pre-trained Weights:** Includes pre-trained weights for MesoNet to streamline model evaluation.
- **Google Colab Notebook:** Provides an interactive environment to run and test the model.

## Tech Stack

- **MesoNet:** Base model for detecting deepfake images.
- **TensorFlow/Keras:** Deep learning framework used for model training and inference.
- **Google Colab:** Interactive notebook environment for running and testing the model.
